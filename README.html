<p>Well we wanted a nice form system, so we made HEAP.</p>

<p>How will it be used?
Errm, I&#8217;ll just leave you to figure it out.</p>

<p>####[Version]
0.0.1</p>

<p>###[New]
- Well, EVERYTHING</p>

<p>###[Changed/Fixed]
- I&#8217;m not tired of writing: EVERYTHING</p>

<p>###[Removed]
- Everything</p>

<p>###[Unreleased]
- You can make suggestions as how to make this better, or better yet, fork it! ðŸ˜†</p>

<p>###[Inspiration]
This is largely inspired by @mdo&#8217;s wtf-form.css https://github.com/mdo/wtf-forms</p>

<p>###[Tools]
So this uses Normalize.css [http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css] to keep things sane across browsers. You can comment out the reset.less during build if you already use one.</p>
