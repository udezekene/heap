#Heap

Well we wanted a nice form system, so we made HEAP.

How will it be used?
Errm, I'll just leave you to figure it out.


####[Version]
0.0.1



###[New]
- Well, EVERYTHING


###[Changed/Fixed]
- I'm not tired of writing: EVERYTHING

###[Removed]
- Everything

###[Unreleased]
- You can make suggestions as how to make this better, or better yet, fork it! ðŸ˜†

###[Inspiration]
This is largely inspired by @mdo's wtf-form.css https://github.com/mdo/wtf-forms


###[Tools]
So this uses Normalize.css [http://github.com/necolas/normalize.css] to keep things sane across browsers. You can comment out the reset.less during build if you already use one.
